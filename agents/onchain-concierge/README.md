To complete your repository's "Four Pillars," we need to make the AI Agent section look like a production-ready roadmap. In the 2026 AI Meta, Coinbase AgentKit is the gold standard for "Agentic Wallets" that can actually hold funds and trade autonomously.

Here is the professional content for your 4th pillar.

Pillar 4: Update agents/onchain-concierge/README.md
Commit Message: feat: define ai agent architecture using coinbase agentkit

🤖 Onchain AI Concierge (Nigeria Edition)
Autonomous AI agents powered by Coinbase AgentKit for the Superchain.
🎯 Objective
To eliminate the technical complexity of blockchain interactions for Nigerian users. This concierge acts as an "intelligent layer" between the user's natural language and the smart contracts on Base and Ink.

🛠️ Implementation Track (Powered by AgentKit)
Agentic Wallets: Deploying non-custodial wallets that allow AI agents to hold USDC and pay for gas autonomously using the x402 protocol.

Natural Language Deployer: Enabling users to type "Launch a Lagos Tech Club NFT on Ink" and having the agent handle the bytecode and deployment.

Smart Guardrails: Implementing programmable spending limits and session caps to ensure fund security for regional builders.

Gasless Interaction: Leveraging AgentKit’s integration with the Base Paymaster to provide a zero-fee entry point for new developers.

🧠 AI Workflow
Perception: User provides intent via chat (e.g., "Bridge 5000 NGN to Ink").

Reasoning: The agent calculates the best route, checks NGN/ETH exchange rates, and verifies gas prices.

Action: Using AgentKit, the agent signs the transaction securely and provides a real-time status update.

💡 The Vision
"In the Nigeria Hub, we don't expect every user to be a coder. We build the agents that do the coding for them."
